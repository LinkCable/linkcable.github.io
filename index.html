                <p>Welcome to my website! <br> <br>
                  I am a Computer Science student at SUNY Stony Brook currently in my Junior year. I first started coding
                  when I was 13, and since then I have loved hacking away at the keyboard and creating cool stuff. My passion is particularly
                  in design; I love when things look good. In that aspect I am personally interested in front-end development, UI, and UX. After all, what's
                  the use of a good program if no one can make sense of it? When not coding, you can find me browsing Reddit, reading The Verge, or reading xkcd.<br>

              <p>As I said, I am a Junior at SUNY Stony Brook in the Computer Science program expecting to graduate in May 2016. I have an overall GPA of 3.83 out of 4.00
                and was accepted into the Computer Science Honors program, which only a select few students (30 or so) are accepted into every year. Apart from Computer Science,
                I am also a University Scholar, a school wide honors program which is only granted to the top 8% of incoming students, and have received a Presidential Scholarship
                as well as been put on the Dean's List every year. I have also studied abroad during my time at Stony Brook in both Paris and Seoul.

              <p>The primary reason I first started coding was because I was sent to camp as kid. But this was no ordinary camp, this was a computer camp! 
                While I was at camp I learned my first language, C++, and important basic concepts such as if statements, loops, arrays. <br> <br>

                ...And now I work there! Since the summer of 2012 I have been serving as counselor at SummerTech Computer Camps in Westchester, where I teach
                kids ranging from 8 to 16 about code (Python, Java, or C++). The kids I've taught have created programs ranging from basic guessing games, 
                to full fledged games like Tic-tac-toe with a GUI. I've also taught Blender (3D Modeling) and HTML/CSS during my time there.

              <p>Other than that, in my senior year of high school I also took on an internship with the Westchester County Government in their IT department. I had two main
                projects while I was there, my first responsbility was to help overhaul the county's tourism website using 
                Joomla. I helped implement a new design by editing CSS and HTML, as well as using the built in tools that Joomla provides. <br> <br>

                My second project while I was there involved cleaning up the county's intranet files. There were many duplicate and old files that had to be removed from their
                server, so using Windows Server 2008 I went in and tediously merged and deleted files in order to make the county's files easier to sort through and refer to
                at their convenience.

              <p>I've also attended a couple hackathons. I have twice attended Google's "24 Hours of Good", a hackathon which is devoted to
                creating projects that will benefit the world. The first hackathon was aimed towards helping non-profit companies who were brought in by Google. I helped
                develop a simple Android app for Green Map System, a company devoted to mapping locations such as recycling centers and businesses that are environmentally
                conscious. <br> <br>

                The second hackathon was devoted towards educating people on Internet safety, so I helped create a web-based game called "Authen2cate" that aimed to have people try and "hack" other websites to show what can happen if others obtain your username and password. I mainly contributed on creating pages that spoofed other popular sites around
                the web, such as <a href="http://philkt.me/Authen2cate/pago.html">PagoAmigo</a> and <a href="http://philkt.me/Authen2cate/foogle.html">Foogle</a>.
