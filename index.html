                <p>Welcome to my website! <br> <br>
                  I am a Computer Science student at SUNY Stony Brook. I first started coding
                  when I was 13, and since then I have loved hacking away at the keyboard and creating cool stuff. My passion is particularly
                  in design; I love when things look good. In that aspect I am personally interested in front-end development, UI, and UX. After all, what's
                  the use of a good program if no one can make sense of it? <br><br>

                  When not coding, you can find me browsing Reddit, reading The Verge, or reading xkcd, or writing reviews of anime and games on my blog. I also
                  volunteer as a translator, taking Japanese comics and putting them into English so a wider audience can read them.

              <p>About my education, I am a Junior at SUNY Stony Brook in the Computer Science program expecting to graduate in May 2016. I have an overall GPA of 3.83 out of 4.00
                and was accepted into the Computer Science Honors program, which only a select few students (30 or so) are accepted into every year. Apart from Computer Science,
                I am also a University Scholar, a school wide honors program which is only granted to the top 8% of incoming students, and have received a Presidential Scholarship
                as well as been put on the Dean's List every year. I have also studied abroad during my time at Stony Brook in both Paris and Seoul.

              <p>The primary reason I first started coding was because I was sent to camp as kid. But this was no ordinary camp, this was a computer camp! 
                While I was at camp I learned my first language, C++, and important basic concepts such as if statements, loops, arrays. <br> <br>

                ...And now I work there! Since the summer of 2012 I have been serving as counselor at SummerTech Computer Camps in Westchester, where I teach
                kids ranging from 8 to 16 about code (Python, Java, or C++). The kids I've taught have created programs ranging from basic guessing games, 
                to full fledged games like Tic-tac-toe with a GUI. I've also taught Blender (3D Modeling) and HTML/CSS during my time there.

            <div class ="col-md-9 content">
              <p>Other than that, in my senior year of high school I also took on an internship with the Westchester County Government in their IT department. I had two main
                projects while I was there, my first responsbility was to help overhaul the county's tourism website using 
                Joomla. I helped implement a new design by editing CSS and HTML, as well as using the built in tools that Joomla provides. <br> <br>

                My second project while I was there involved cleaning up the county's intranet files. There were many duplicate and old files that had to be removed from their
                server, so using Windows Server 2008 I went in and tediously merged and deleted files in order to make the county's files easier to sort through and refer to
                at their convenience.

        <div class = "container hack">
           <div class="col-md-9 content">
              <p>I've also attended a couple hackathons. I have twice attended Google's "24 Hours of Good", a hackathon which is devoted to
                creating projects that will benefit the world. The first hackathon was aimed towards helping non-profit companies who were brought in by Google. I helped
                develop a simple Android app for Green Map System, a company devoted to mapping locations such as recycling centers and businesses that are environmentally
                conscious. <br> <br>

                The second hackathon was devoted towards educating people on Internet safety, so I helped create a web-based game called "Authen2cate" that aimed to have people try and "hack" other websites to show what can happen if others obtain your username and password. I mainly contributed on creating pages that spoofed other popular sites around
                the web, such as <a href="http://philkt.me/Authen2cate/pago.html">PagoAmigo</a> and <a href="http://philkt.me/Authen2cate/foogle.html">Foogle</a <br><br>

               I am the President of the Japanese Student Organization (JSO), which aims to help
                foreign exchange students from Japan adjust to life in the U.S. and also promotes Japanese culture across campus. We hold many events cooperating with other Asian
                clubs, such as Sports Day and Japan Night, which require intricate planning of resources, extensive preparations, and campus-wide advertising. I am in charge of all
                these decisions, as well as running weekly general body meetings.

            <p> In terms of tech clubs on campus. I am Treasurer of the Stony Brook Game Developers (SBGD), which focuses on bringing together aspiring game developers 
                on campus, whether they be programmers, musicians, artists, etc. under one roof to make games. In the past we've had workshops such as "Build Your First Game" and 24 Hour 
                Game Jams. We help people playtest their games and submit them to the Stony Brook Game Competition that happens in the spring.

              I am also proud to be the Interclub Affairs representative for the Stony Brook Computing Society (SBCS). SBCS is a club dedicated to anyone passionate about programming, computers, or technology. SBCS hosts a multitude of different events, such as Tech Talks where students, faculty, or professionals give presentations on different topics. Previous Tech Talks have been about Git, 3D modeling, and career building. Aside from that, SBCS is also planning the first hackathon at Stony Brook campus called "Unhackathon" for late September 2014.My position has me reponsible for telling other technology related clubs about SBCS events and to make SBCS members aware of other clubs like SBCS on campus.

              I'm part of one last club on campus, which is RecycleIT. RecycleIT is a club which is dedicated to refurbishing old computers and printers that have been donated either by 
              Stony Brook University or local businesses. After repairing them, we then donate them to local schools or charities in need of computers. As the Secretary of RecycleIT, my 
              primary responsibility is finding schools and that require our computers and having them donated.
