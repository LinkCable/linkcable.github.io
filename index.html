                <p>Welcome to my website! <br> <br>
                  I am a Computer Science student at SUNY Stony Brook currently in my Junior year. I first started coding
                  when I was 13, and since then I have loved hacking away at the keyboard and creating cool stuff. My passion is particularly
                  in design; I love when things look good. In that aspect I am personally interested in front-end development, UI, and UX. After all, what's
                  the use of a good program if no one can make sense of it? <br>

            <div class ="col-md-9 content">
              <p>The primary reason I first started coding was because I was sent to camp as kid. But this was no ordinary camp, this was a computer camp! 
                While I was at camp I learned my first language, C++, and important basic concepts such as if statements, loops, arrays. <br> <br>

                ...And now I work there! Since the summer of 2012 I have been serving as counselor at SummerTech Computer Camps in Westchester, where I teach
                kids ranging from 8 to 16 about code (Python, Java, or C++). The kids I've taught have created programs ranging from basic guessing games, 
                to full fledged games like Tic-tac-toe with a GUI. I've also taught Blender (3D Modeling) and HTML/CSS during my time there.
